/*PROJECT CASE STUDY*/
/*The management wants to understand the conditions of the sales activities and gain insights into the various trends 
happening in the Bike Sales volume between 2016 and 2018. They also want to know the revenues per region, per store and per product
category and per brand. the lists of sales representatives and customers are also needed. All these infornation are stored in different tables 
and for that reason, these tables are going to be joined in order to gather the necessary data from these tables for the analysis.*/

/*A SQL script that generates a dataset consisting of the order id, customers first and last names, the customers city and state, 
the order date, sales volume, revenue, product name, product category, brand name, store name, and sales representatives. 
These fields are scattered across separate but related tables in the bike stores database. A series of table joins is used to generate the 
dataset*/
